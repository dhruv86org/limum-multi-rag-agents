## Budget Best Practices

### Zero-Based Budgeting

**Principles:**
- Start from zero each year
- Justify every expense
- Challenge status quo
- Prioritize based on value
- Question "we've always done it this way"

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates budget creep
- Identifies inefficiencies
- Reallocates to highest priorities
- Promotes cost consciousness

**Implementation:**
- Require business case for all spending
- Benchmark against industry standards
- Evaluate alternatives
- Link spend to strategic objectives

### Rolling Forecasts

**Instead of static annual budget:**
- Maintain 12-month rolling forecast
- Update quarterly
- More agile and responsive
- Reduces budget gaming

**Process:**
- Each quarter, add new quarter to forecast
- Drop the past quarter
- Always looking 12 months ahead
- Adjust based on latest information

### Activity-Based Budgeting

**Link budget to activities and outputs:**
```
Traditional:
  - Marketing budget: $1,000,000
  
Activity-Based:
  - Generate 10,000 MQLs @ $40/lead = $400,000
  - Convert 1,000 SQLs @ $200/lead = $200,000
  - Close 100 customers @ $4,000/customer = $400,000
  - Total marketing: $1,000,000
```

**Benefits:**
- Clearer link between spend and results
- Better accountability
- Easier to adjust based on performance
- Focuses on outcomes not inputs

### Contingency Planning

**Build in contingency buffers:**
- Revenue: Plan conservatively (80% of best case)
- Expenses: Include 5-10% contingency
- Timing: Assume delays in hiring and projects
- Hold back some budget for unexpected needs

**Reserve Allocation:**
- CEO reserve: 2-3% of total budget
- Unallocated for opportunities and emergencies
- Require CEO approval to access
- Report usage monthly
